This folder contains work on the third part of the PINK experimentation. 

It will attempt to use the rotation matrix of sources and the derived IR host position from Radio Galaxy Zoo to overlay them onto the IR host position in the IR channel of derived SOMs. 

This builds upon the work performed in `Experiments_Two` and work in Galvin et al. (2018), PASP.
